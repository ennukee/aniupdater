# AniUpdater
### A quick and simplistic approach to updating many titles at once

AniUpdater is built upon the wonderful API provided by AniList to provide users with the fastest way of updating many titles in one sitting. All done without a mouse -- every step of the way is controlled via keyboard. Save your wrists the unnecessary work.

## Why?

To be upfront, it's because I was taking *way* too long whenever I logged onto AniList to update my manga every 1-2 months. I had anywhere between 50-150 manga titles to update and it was a nasty process. Thus, a thought flashed through my mind: "wait, I have the skillset to make this simpler". And so, I did. What you see here is the fruits of many hours of slamming my face against a keyboard until CSS decided to wor-- I mean many hours of troubleshooting. Yes, that.

The website has been officially released to the public! Please keep in mind there are likely still lingering bugs that will appear as a result of wider use. Please report them via a github issue!

## Contribution Guidelines

Please see CONTRIBUTING.md for information on contributing to this open source project.

## Development Setup

This is a fairly simplistic (for both my sake and others') application structure, so it should be fairly easy to set up.

### Fork & clone the repository

Unless you're a maintainer, you will need to fork the repository with the **Fork** button in the top right of this page. This makes a copy of the repository under your name which you have push rights to. This is where you will do your development.

Next, clone your forked repository onto your computer.

### Install

Run `npm install` or `yarn` -- both should work and automatically download every package and dependency you'll need to run this.

### Make a branch and go

Next you'll need to make a branch on your fork (never work right out of master!) and start development on an issue (bug or approved feature request) from [the Issues tab here](https://github.com/ennukee/aniupdater/issues)! Please try to leave a comment on the ticket that you'll be attempting to tackle it so that others don't waste their time. Nobody has a direct "right" over any ticket, including yourself, do not be surprised if someone takes over a ticket if it taking you longer than it should to solve it.
