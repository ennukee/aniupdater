# AniUpdater
### A quick and simplistic approach to updating many titles at once

AniUpdater is built upon the wonderful API provided by AniList to provide users with the fastest way of updating many titles in one sitting. All done without a mouse -- every step of the way is controlled via keyboard. Save your wrists the unnecessary work.

## Why?

To be upfront, it's because I was taking *way* too long whenever I logged onto AniList to update my manga every 1-2 months. I had anywhere between 50-150 manga titles to update and it was a nasty process. Thus, a thought flashed through my mind: "wait, I have the skillset to make this simpler". And so, I did. What you see here is the fruits of many hours of slamming my face against a keyboard until CSS decided to wor-- I mean many hours of troubleshooting. Yes, that.

**This project is still under active development as of 9/25/2019 and is not released to the public yet.** I estimate that this will be finished sometime around mid to late October, but it all depends on how much of my luxuries I want to implement before I consider the website ready for launch.

Here's a sneak peak of some of the very early design of the website
